In contrast to the United States, competition in English and Dutch healthcare develops from the principle of universal access to healthcare, which appears antithetical to competition. Unsurprisingly, competition reforms in both a health insurance system (the Netherlands) and a taxation-funded National Health Service (NHS) (England) have proved controversial. Such reforms are also proving difficult to implement, with both countries developing 'healthcare-specific' modifications of general competition rules and differing relationships between the competition authorities and healthcare regulators in applying these."

Organized around the seven Anishinaabe grandmother and grandfather teachings of love, truth, bravery, humility, wisdom, honesty, and respect, this book explores ethics in relation to Aboriginal issues including title, treaties, legal education, and residential schools. With characteristic depth and sensitivity, John Borrows brings insights drawn from philosophy, law, and political science to bear on some of the most pressing issues that arise in contemplating the interaction between Canadian state law and Indigenous legal traditions. In the course of a wide-ranging but accessible inquiry, he discusses such topics as Indigenous agency, self-determination, legal pluralism, and power. In its use of Anishinaabe stories and methodologies drawn from the emerging field of Indigenous studies, Law's Indigenous Ethics makes a significant contribution to scholarly debate and is an essential resource for readers seeking a deeper understanding of Indigenous rights, societies, and cultures.\"--"

      "#text": "Southern Italy was conquered by the Norman Hauteville dynasty in the late eleventh century after over five hundred years of continuous Byzantine rule. At a stroke, the region's Greek Christian inhabitants were cut off from their Orthodox compatriots in Byzantium and became subject to the spiritual and legal jurisdiction of the Roman Catholic popes. Nonetheless, they continued to follow the religious laws of the Byzantine church; out of thirty-six surviving manuscripts of Byzantine canon law produced between the tenth and fourteenth centuries, the majority date to the centuries after the Norman conquest. Byzantine Religious Law in Medieval Italy is a historical study of these manuscripts, exploring how and why the Greek Christians of medieval southern Italy persisted in using them so long after the end of Byzantine rule. The first part of the book provides an overview of the source material and the history of Italo-Greek Christianity. The second part examines the development of Italo-Greek canon law manuscripts from the last century of Byzantine rule to the late twelfth century, arguing that the Normans' opposition to papal authority created a laissez faire atmosphere in which Greek Christians could continue to follow Byzantine religious law unchallenged. Finally, the third part analyses the papacy's successful efforts to assert its jurisdiction over southern Italy in the later Middle Ages. While this brought about the end of Byzantine canon law as an effective legal system in the region, the Italo-Greeks still drew on their legal heritage to explain and justify their distinctive religious rites to their Latin neighbours."

      "#text": "This book provides fair and acceptable solutions to hardship issues in long-term relational supply contracts. This book uses an approach to strike a balance between the traditional approach underlying classical contract law which emphasises the almost absolute prevalence of the principle of pacta sunt servanda and a flexible approach that is based on the principle of clausula rebus sic stantibus. This book argues for an emerging principle of pacta sunt servanda bona fide on the basis of the relational contract theory. Additionally, this book demonstrates how good faith can serve as a foundation for imposing a duty to renegotiate on the parties. The aim of this book is rather to propose how relational contract theory can be applied to the analysis of specific legal rules in general. Lastly, this boos highlights how the duty to renegotiate and the power to adapt a contract can be further developed upon the occurrence of hardship, based on good faith and the relational nature and characteristics of a long-term relational supply contract. This book explores and enriches the existing research on relational contract theory concentrates primarily on its application in domestic contract laws, particularly in the regulation of long-term contracts in American contract law. As an outcome this book provides a more feasible and satisfactory approach for courts or arbitral tribunals to undertake when facing hardship issues in international contract disputes. Overall, hardship themes, long-term relational supply contracts and good faith are examined extensively."

Veterans Benefits: Law, Theory, and Practice aims to meet that need. The book presents the statutory and regulatory provisions pertinent to the issues that commonly arise in pursuing claims for veterans and their family members, and it includes copious relevant cases, summarized with follow-up questions for discussion. But the textbook also contains straightforward practical explanation about how to work through claims and work with the government bureaucrats who process them.

The work analyses the inherent gravities of the core crimes and places them in relation to each other. Moreover, the Rome Statute itself as well as several national regulations of States Parties and Non-States Parties are investigated in respect to indications for an underlying ranking of these crimes.

Each story unfolds along boundaries\u2015between men and women, slave and free, black and white, rich and poor, old and young\u2015as rigid social orders are upset in ways that drive people into the courtroom. One case involves a settler in a rural county along the Colorado River, his thirty-year relationship with an enslaved woman, and the claims of their children as heirs. A case in East Texas arose after an owner refused to pay an overseer who had shot one of her slaves. Another case details how a free family of color carved out a life in the sparsely populated marshland of Southeast Texas, only to lose it all as waves of new settlers \u201ccivilized\u201d the county. An enslaved woman in Galveston who was set free in her owner\u2019s will\u2015and who got an uncommon level of support from her attorneys\u2015is the subject of another case. In a Central Texas community, as another case recounts, citizens forced a Choctaw native into court in an effort to gain freedom for his slave, a woman who easily \u201cpassed\u201d as white. The cases considered here include Gaines v. Thomas, Clark v. Honey, Brady v. Price, and Webster v. Heard. All of them pitted communal attitudes and values against the exigencies of daily life in an often harsh place. Here are real people in their own words, as gathered from trial records, various legal documents, and many other sources. People of many colors, from diverse backgrounds, weave their way in and out of the narratives. We come to know what mattered most to them\u2015and where those personal concerns stood before the law.\"--"

      "#text": "The major financial scandals of the past decade have led to the enactment of massive Congressional statutes in the United States that impact the world of finance. The approval of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in 2002, with its significant provisions of 20-year imprisonment for certain offenses, and the conviction of Enron's CEO and other senior executives, finally caught the attention of corporate executives. \"Corporate Governance and Finance Law\" is designed to educate students, researchers, and practitioners on the legal aspects of corporate financial markets within the United States, the Eurozone, and China. Readers are introduced to the basic legal forms of corporate governance, the impact of recent federal legislation on corporate governance, and an examination of other basic forms of corporate governance globally. A brief overview of the major statutes affecting securities is also discussed, with a focus on the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The book concludes with a discussion of investment swaps made during the 2008 financial crisis."

The IDD came into force on 1 October 2018 and regulates the distribution of insurance products in the EU. The book examines the main changes accompanying the IDD and analyses its impact on insurance distributors, i.e., insurance intermediaries and insurance undertakings, as well as the market. Drawing on interrelations between the rules of the Directive and other fields that are relevant to the distribution of insurance products, it explores various topics related to the interpretation of the IDD - e.g. the harmonization achieved under it; its role as a benchmark for national legislators; and its interplay with other regulations and sciences - while also providing an empirical analysis of the standardised pre-contractual information document. Accordingly, the book offers a wealth of valuable insights for academics, regulators, practitioners and students who are interested in issues concerning insurance distribution."

      "#text": "Il dibattito sull\u2019esistenza nel mondo romano di una sensibilit\u00e0 verso gli effetti nefasti che le attivit\u00e0 produttive determinavano sull\u2019ambiente si \u00e8 fatto in questi ultimi decenni sempre pi\u00f9 intenso, specchiandosi nei terribili problemi a cui il pianeta sta andando incontro con la sempre pi\u00f9 grave crisi climatica in corso. Una parte rilevante della ricerca storico-giuridica ritiene che i Romani avessero sviluppato una coscienza empiricamente fondata delle deleterie conseguenze dell\u2019agire economico sulla vivibilit\u00e0 dell\u2019ambiente, o almeno che provvedimenti miranti ad altri scopi potessero indirettamente favorirne la protezione. Sulla base di una lettura quanto pi\u00f9 attenta possibile delle fonti, questo libro giunge alla conclusione che, fatte salve poche voci minoritarie, la conservazione degli ambienti non fu mai al centro delle preoccupazioni degli operatori economici. Neanche i giuristi elessero la tutela dell\u2019ambiente a parametro di valutazione dell\u2019agire economico. Ci\u00f2 non toglie che preoccupazioni soprattutto sanitarie abbiano talora indotto gli operatori del diritto ad elaborare strumenti per la difesa delle condizioni di vita negli agglomerati urbani. --"

      "#text": "\"Understanding Sports Law provides a comprehensive overview of the legal issues and concepts that emerge from relationships existing within American sport. It captures the legal doctrine and rules arising from judicial decisions, state and federal legislation, and the private law created by associations and other sport entities. In doing so, Understanding Sports Law examines a vast array of different substantive areas of law as applied in the sports context. These include contracts, torts, intellectual property, antitrust, labor law and constitutional law. While this treatise's primary focus is on articulating the current legal principles governing relationships in sport, it often discusses the historical evolution of such rules in order to contextualize and foster an understanding of today's controlling principles. It also guides the reader through legal and regulatory developments shaping the future of the sports industry, such as name, image, and likeness marketing opportunities for collegiate athletes and race and gender equity movements across the sports landscape. This treatise can serve as a helpful companion to a casebook or as a stand-alone resource and will prove useful for law students, law professors, and practitioners alike\" --"

The Concept of the Civilian examines how the processes of international criminal justice construct legal recognition of the civilian victims of contemporary armed conflicts. Drawing on a detailed case-study of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), this book examines two key issues central to these justice processes. Firstly, how civilians are understood as a social and legal category of persons; and secondly, how legal practices shape victim identities and redress in relation to these persons. Combining socio-legal concepts and methodologies with insights from transitional justice scholarship, Claire Garbett thus traces the historical emergence of the concept of the civilian, and critically examines how the different stages of legal proceedings produce its conceptual form in distinction from that of combatants. This book shows that the very notions of 'civilian', 'protection' and 'redress' that underpin current practices of international criminal justice continue to evoke both definitional difficulties and analytic contestation. Accordingly, it remains unclear how the practices of international criminal justice work to address and redress the civilian victims of contemporary armed conflicts. \"--"

Buyers make decisions by relying on their knowledge of the products available, and sellers decide what to produce based on their understanding of what buyers want. But the distribution of market information has changed, as consumers increasingly turn to sources that act as intermediaries for information--companies like Yelp and Google. Antitrust Law in the New Economy considers a wide range of problems that arise around one aspect of information in the marketplace: its quality. Sellers now have the ability and motivation to distort the truth about their products when they make data available to intermediaries. And intermediaries, in turn, have their own incentives to skew the facts they provide to buyers, both to benefit advertisers and to gain advantages over their competition. Consumer protection law is poorly suited for these problems in the information economy. Antitrust law, designed to regulate powerful firms and prevent collusion among producers, is a better choice. But the current application of antitrust law pays little attention to information quality. Mark Patterson discusses a range of ways in which data can be manipulated for competitive advantage and exploitation of consumers (as happened in the LIBOR scandal), and he considers novel issues like \"confusopoly\" and sellers' use of consumers' personal information in direct selling. Antitrust law can and should be adapted for the information economy, Patterson argues, and he shows how courts can apply antitrust to address today's problems\"--"

Social security and its articulation as a human right have received increased attention in recent years both in response to austerity cuts to welfare in developed countries and as a means of lifting millions out of poverty in developing countries. Women, disproportionately affected by poverty in all parts of the world, stand to gain from a right to social security that takes cognisance of gender discrimination and disadvantage. This book interprets and redefines the right to social security from a gender perspective. Drawing on feminist theory, the book formulates a conceptual approach and a set of principles for a substantively equal, gendered right to social security. In so doing, it challenges the relationship between the right to social security and traditional conceptions of work that exclude women's labour including their caring roles. It argues that the right must have application at the transnational level if it is to address the changing nature of women's work due to globalisation."

      "#text": "Although recent family law debates have been predominantly paedo-centric, the founding of \"bio-medically assisted families\" still focuses on the individual parents' rights to reproduce. By introducing donations, the donor's genetic contribution becomes instrumental, and the legal attribution of parenthood is negotiated through expressed intentions. The absence of a genetic, social, and/or legal father can only occur in single women's conceptions by choice, hence calling into question the role of the societal father. This neglects the future child's voice in private and family life issues on at least two levels: the informational level (lacking information about origins, often related to personal identity) and the legal/functional level (care provided by both parents). Furthermore, it emphasizes the inconsistency in the treatment of \"naturally\" and \"artificially\" conceived children, since the latter have restricted access to parental judicial proceedings. The conflicts between individuals in the family go beyond national family laws and become a matter of reconciling progenitors' and children's human rights. Yet, the discrepancies between different civil law jurisdictions are remarkable. In addition, the sensitivity of the filiation of children conceived by sperm donation to single women requires more than legal solutions - it requires an interdisciplinary approach encompassing ethics, psychology, anthropology, and sociology. Moreover, in debating the situation and suggesting solutions, the issue also becomes political. This book clarifies many concepts and examines the rationale behind this legal complexity in ten national European jurisdictions. It also confronts the rights and responsibilities of the stakeholders, providing a balanced independent conclusion and suggestions towards international harmonization.--"

This book focuses on the millions of people suffering from AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. Beginning with the AIDS campaign for antiretroviral medicines (ARVs), Sharifah Sekalala argues that a soft law approach is more effective than hard law by critiquing the current Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) flexibilities within the WTO. She then considers how soft law has also been instrumental in the fight against malaria and tuberculosis. Using these compelling case studies, this book explores law-making on global health and analyzes the viability of current global health financing trends within new and traditional organizations such as the UN, WHO, UNAIDS, UNITAID and The Global Fund. This book is essential reading for legal, development, policy and health scholars, activists, and policymakers working across political economy, policy studies and global health studies.\"--Back cover."

D'une part, ce sont des normes obligatoirement applique\u0301es par le juge national dans le champ du droit de l'Union. D'autre part, en dehors du champ, ils constituent une source d'inspiration pour le Conseil d'E\u0301tat dans la cre\u0301ation et l'interpre\u0301tation des principes ge\u0301ne\u0301raux du droit franc\u0327ais. Dans le premier cas, le juge administratif est garant du respect de ces principes.Fide\u0300le aux exigences de la Cour de justice, il assume pleinement son ro\u0302le de juge de droit commun de l'application des principes du droit de l'Union. Dans le second cas, il devient acteur de la circulation des principes en Europe. Toutefois la coexistence des principes peut engendrer des tensions, accentue\u0301es par la difficulte\u0301 a\u0300 de\u0301limiter le champ du droit de l'Union, incertain et en pleine expansion. C'est pourquoi la the\u0300se propose le de\u0301ploiement d'une politique jurisprudentielle de convergence, dans laquelle le juge administratif affirmerait explicitement son souci de s'inspirer des principes du droit de l'Union. Ces derniers, combine\u0301s avec les principes issus de la Charte des droits fondamentaux, de la CEDH et des ordres nationaux, semblent donner naissance a\u0300 une nouvelle cate\u0301gorie de source mate\u0301rielle : les principes europe\u0301ens communs. L'originalite\u0301 de celle-ci, qui la diffe\u0301rencie de toute autre source, est de constituer une \u0153uvre collective des juges en Europe, dans laquelle ces derniers puisent leur inspiration pour cre\u0301er de nouveaux principes ou interpre\u0301ter les principes existants."

And yet, as daily events underscore, we are ever more vulnerable to cyber attack. In this bracing book, Michael Chertoff makes clear that personal data has become one of the most valuable assets of the modern age; and yet our laws and policies surrounding the protection of personal information were written for an earlier time and need to be completely overhauled in the Internet era. On the one hand, the collection of data--more widespread even by business than by government, and impossible to stop--should be facilitated as an ultimate protection for society. On the other, standards under which information can be inspected, analyzed, or used must be significantly tightened. In offering his compelling call for action, Chertoff argues that what is at stake is not the simple loss of privacy, which is almost impossible to protect, but that of individual autonomy--the ability to make personal choices free of manipulation or coercion. Offering colorful stories over many decades, through to the present, that illuminate the three periods of data gathering we have experienced, Chertoff explains the complex legalities surrounding issues of data collection and dissemination today, and charts a forceful new strategy that balances the needs of individuals, government, and business alike.\"--Jacket."

The study offers an in-depth comparative and empirical analysis of the way these instruments function in interaction with national procedures in England and Wales, France, Italy, and Romania. The analysis combines available statistics with European and national case law, together with practitioners' experience. This approach provides a comprehensive understanding of the difficulties encountered, and of the solutions chosen to overcome procedural intricacies and to secure parties' procedural rights. The findings create a solid basis for enhancing judicial cooperation and addressing the practical aspects related to the application of the procedures. In its conclusion, the book discusses the ongoing developments taking shape in this area, and reflects on the implications that the legal standards established by the European uniform procedures have for future developments."

Although there are no special responsibility regimes for different functions of the state, the application of investment treaty standards and the threshold for their breach may vary depending on the function involved. Accordingly, in order for the state to incur responsibility for a wrongful act committed in the exercise of its judicial function, there are some specific conditions that should be met: the investor must establish that the state is responsible for a breach attributable to the state; the investment tribunal has jurisdiction over the particular dispute; and the damage that the investor has suffered is a result of the particular breach. Berk Demirkol addresses questions in relation to the substance, jurisdiction, admissibility, and remedies in cases where state responsibility arises from a wrongful judicial act."

It is largely and conspicuously revealed by the litigation before the courts of, both, the European Union and its Member States. The concern faithfully to give the European treaty the authentic meaning and scope as intended by its authors permeates the European courts' judgments, and the constant theme of the entitlement of those vested with rights conferred by the law of the European Union to effective judicial protection is omnipresent in their decisions. The law of European integration has been uncharted territory. The novelty of various issues which have arisen and on which the courts have had to pronounce springs from the originality of the integration venture and is commensurate with its uniqueness, distinctive nature and specific exigencies. The writings here assembled allow to trace the starting point since the inceptive formative years of the growth of a legal doctrine and an evolving jurisprudential edifice in several areas, to appraise their direction and constancy and to assay adjustments and adaptations.--"

Classical jurisprudence is presented as a synthesis of the work of the greatest minds of antiquity and the medieval period, including Cicero, Aristotle, Gratian, Augustine, and Aquinas; the significant texts of each receive detailed exposition in these pages. Along with [the author's] development of the architectural image, he raises a question that becomes a running theme throughout the book: To what extent does one need to know God to accept and understand natural law jurisprudence, given its foundational premise that all authority comes from God? The separation of the study of law from knowledge of theology and morality, [the author] argues, only results in the impoverishment of our understanding of law.

The authors draw on fieldwork from across the archipelago to analyse how judges and ordinary people apply interpretations of law, religion, and gender in deliberating and deciding in property disputes that arise at moments of marriage, divorce, and death. The chapters go beyond the world of legal and scriptural texts to ask how women in fact fare in these contexts. Women's capabilities and resources in Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim society and one with distinctive traditions of legal and social life, provides a critical knowledge base for advancing our understanding of the social life of Islamic law.

While the Union had initially developed anti-discrimination norms that served only the commercial rationale of the common market, focusing on nationality (of a Member State) and gender as protected grounds, the Treaty of Amsterdam (1997) supplied five additional prohibited grounds of discrimination to the EU legislative palette, in line with a much broader egalitarian rationale. In 2000, two EU Equality Directives followed, one focusing on race and ethnic origin, the other covering the remaining four grounds introduced by the Treaty of Amsterdam, namely religion, sexual orientation, disabilities and age, eighteen years, which is considered to be the age of adulthood in most of European countries. After the adoption of the watershed Equality Directives, it seems timely to dedicate a book to their limits and prospects, the progress made and to revisit the rise of EU anti-discrimination law beyond gender. This volume sets out to capture the striking developments and shortcomings that have taken place in the interpretation of relevant EU secondary law. Firstly, the book unfolds an up-to-date systemic reappraisal of the five 'newer' grounds of discrimination, which have so far received mostly fragmented coverage. Secondly, and more generally, the volume captures the ways in which and the extent to which the Equality Directives have enabled or, at times, prevented the Court of Justice of the European Union from developing even broader and more refined anti-discrimination jurisprudence."

Conducting business is impossible without venturing into new territories and even the most ordinary daily choices could turn out to be failures. Excessive risk, however, can be very detrimental as was starkly illustrated by the most recent financial crisis. By criminalising managers' excessive risk-taking criminal law enters a sphere which is at the core of the activity it affects. At the same time it provides for criminal punishment for courses of conduct that, without doubt, can be extremely harmful. The objective of this book is to examine existing criminalisation of excessive risk-taking as well as to analyse whether such criminalisation is desirable and if yes, under which conditions."

The handbook covers a broad range of issues, including the role of ethics in Islamic jurisprudence, the mechanics and processes of interpretation, the purposes and objectives of Islamic law, constitutional law and secularism, gender, bioethics, Muslim minorities in the West, jihad and terrorism. Previous publications on this topic have approached Islamic law from a variety of disciplinary and pedagogical perspectives. One of the original features of this handbook is that it treats Islamic law as a legal discipline by taking into account the historical functions and processes of legal cultures and the patterns of legal thought. With contributions from a selection of highly regarded and leading scholars in this field, the Routledge Handbook of Islamic Law is an essential resource for students and scholars who are interested in the field of Islamic Law."

      "#text": "Less than a decade after the Financial Crisis, we are witnessing the fast emergence of a new financial order driven by three different, yet interconnected, dynamics: first, the rapid application of technology - such as big data, machine learning, and distributed computing - to banking, lending, and investing, in particular with the emergence of virtual currencies and digital finance; second, a disintermediation fuelled by the rise of peer-to-peer lending platforms and crowd investment which challenge the traditional banking model and may, over time, lead to a transformation of the way both retail and corporate customers bank; and, third, a tendency of de-bureaucratisation under which new platforms and technologies challenge established organisational patterns that regulate finance and manage the money supply. These changes are to a significant degree driven by the development of blockchain technology. The aim of this book is to understand the technological and business potential of the blockchain technology and to reflect on its legal challenges. The book mainly focuses on the challenges blockchain technology has so far faced in its first application in the areas of virtual money and finance, as well as those that it will inevitably face (and is partially already facing, as the SEC Investigative Report of June 2017 and an ongoing SEC securities fraud investigation show) as its domain of application expands in other fields of economic activity such as smart contracts and initial coin offerings. The book provides an unparalleled critical analysis of the disruptive potential of this technology for the economy and the legal system and contributes to current thinking on the role of law in harvesting and shaping innovation."

It also explores the scope and meaning of sustainability and sustainable development in the energy field. Challenged by sustainability imperatives, the world faces a transition in how it uses and produces energy. Yet, despite the indisputable interdependence between energy and the environment, law in these two areas has developed separately, with little consideration for how the logic and aims of each might be reconciled. This innovative book addresses this crucial nexus, exploring the role that law must inevitably play as the effects of fossil fuel-induced climate change continue to radically affect every aspect of life on Earth\"--Publisher's website."

      "#text": "\"Charges, denials, and countercharges of bigotry are increasingly frequent in the U.S. Bigotry is a fraught and contested term, evident from the rejoinder that calling out bigotry is political correctness. That is so even though renouncing- and denouncing-bigotry seems to be a shared political value with a long history. Identifying, responding to, and preventing bigotry have engaged the efforts of many people. People disagree, however, over who is a bigot and what makes a belief, attitude, or action bigoted. This book argues that bigotry has both a backward- and forward-looking dimension. We learn bigotry's meaning by looking to the past, but bigotry also has an important forward-looking dimension. Past examples of bigotry on which there is consensus become the basis for prospective judgments about analogous forms of bigotry. The rhetoric of bigotry-how people use such words as \"bigot,\" \"bigoted,\" and \"bigotry\"-poses puzzles that urgently demand attention. Those include whether bigotry concerns the motivation for or the content of a belief or action; whether reasonableness is a defense to charges of bigotry; whether the bigot is a distinct type, or whether we are all a bit bigoted; and whether \"bigotry\" is the term society gives to beliefs that now are beyond the pale. This book addresses those puzzles by examining prior controversies over interfaith and interracial marriage and the recent controversy over same-sex marriage, as well as controversies over landmark civil rights law and more recent conflicts between religious liberty and state antidiscrimination laws protecting LGBTQ persons\"--"

For the past forty years, students enrolled in the school's extensive clinical program have helped shape the law on the cutting edge of the legal system under the guidance of faculty members who train future lawyers not just to make money but to make social change. This book describes the diverse activities of the law school clinics, which range from challenging the constitutionality of the war in Iraq to providing equal funding for inner city schools. It describes how eager students have helped invalidate zoning laws that screened out affordable housing in upscale suburbs; successfully challenged inhumane conditions of confinement of immigrant asylum seekers by the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service; guaranteed fair hearings for persons denied Social Security and disability benefits; protected citizens who verbally protested parking tickets from the wrath of authoritarian judges; aided families with special-needs children to navigate the institutional bureaucracy and obtain their rights; forced municipalities to open their public parks to residents from neighboring communities; secured free elections and free speech for residents of common-interest communities governed by tyrannical trustees; won hiring and promotional rights for non-whites in police and fire departments; and helped change the way the pubic views non-human sensient beings. In 26 essays, Rutgers Law School faculty members explain how clinics in constitutional litigation, environmental law, child advocacy, special education, urban justice and animal rights used live clients and current issues to train students to represent the public interest and reform the law while learning the tools of their trade. Editor Frank Askin is Distinguished Professor of Law and founding director of the Rutgers School of Law-Newark's pioneering Constitutional Litigation Clinic. For the past forty years, he has been litigating high-profile civil rights cases and training new generations of public interest lawyers. Back in the McCarthy/J. Edgar Hoover Era, he brought the first cases challenging the right of government agencies to engage in surveillance of law-abiding political protesters and challenged highway profiling by state troopers. Ever since, he has been on the forefront of issues involving free speech, racial discrimination, police practices and election reform. One of his current cases challenges the legality of the war in Iraq absent a Congressional Declaration. He is listed in Woodward & White's \"Best Lawyers in America.\""

      "#text": "A work of extraordinary range and striking originality, The Gun, the Ship, and the Pen traces the global history of written constitutions from the 1750s to the twentieth century, modifying accepted narratives and uncovering the close connections between the making of constitutions and the making of war. In the process, Linda Colley both reappraises famous constitutions and recovers those that have been marginalized but were central to the rise of a modern world. She brings to the fore neglected sites, such as Corsica, with its pioneering constitution of 1755, and tiny Pitcairn Island in the Pacific, the first place on the globe to permanently enfranchise women. She highlights the role of unexpected players, such as Catherine the Great of Russia, who was experimenting with constitutional techniques with her enlightened Nakaz decades before the Founding Fathers framed the American constitution. Written constitutions are usually examined in relation to individual states, but Colley focuses on how they crossed boundaries, spreading into six continents by 1918 and aiding the rise of empires as well as nations. She also illumines their place not simply in law and politics but also in wider cultural histories, and their intimate connections with print, literary creativity, and the rise of the novel. Colley shows how--while advancing epic revolutions and enfranchising white males--constitutions frequently served over the long nineteenth century to marginalize indigenous people, exclude women and people of color, and expropriate land. Simultaneously, though, she investigates how these devices were adapted by peoples and activists outside the West seeking to resist European and American power. She describes how Tunisia generated the first modern Islamic constitution in 1861, quickly suppressed, but an influence still on the Arab Spring; how Africanus Horton of Sierra Leone--inspired by the American Civil War--devised plans for self-governing nations in West Africa; and how Japan's Meiji constitution of 1889 came to complete with Western constitutionalism as a model for Indian, Chinese, and Ottoman nationalists and reformers. Vividly written and handsomely illustrated, The Gun, the Ship, and the Pen is an absorbing work that--with its pageant of formative wars, powerful leaders, visionary lawmaker and committed rebels--retells the story of consitutional government and the evoluation of ideas of what it means to be modern. --"

      "#text": "\"Because of the increasing use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs, also commonly known as drones) in various military and para-military (i.e., CIA) settings, there has been increasing debate in the international community as to whether it is morally and ethically permissible to allow robots (flying or otherwise) the ability to decide when and where to take human life. In addition, there has been intense debate as to the legal aspects, particularly from a humanitarian law framework. In response to this growing international debate, the United States government released the Department of Defense (DoD) 3000.09 Directive (2011), which sets a policy for if and when autonomous weapons would be used in US military and para-military engagements. This US policy asserts that only \"human-supervised autonomous weapon systems may be used to select and engage targets, with the exception of selecting humans as targets, for local defense ...\". This statement implies that outside of defensive applications, autonomous weapons will not be allowed to independently select and then fire upon targets without explicit approval from a human supervising the autonomous weapon system. Such a control architecture is known as human supervisory control, where a human remotely supervises an automated system (Sheridan 1992). The defense caveat in this policy is needed because the United States currently uses highly automated systems for defensive purposes, e.g., Counter Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar (C-RAM) systems and Patriot anti-missile missiles. Due to the time-critical nature of such environments (e.g., soldiers sleeping in barracks within easy reach of insurgent shoulder-launched missiles), these automated defensive systems cannot rely upon a human supervisor for permission because of the short engagement times and the inherent human neuromuscular lag which means that even if a person is paying attention, there is approximately a half-second delay in hitting a firing button, which can mean the difference for life and death for the soldiers in the barracks. So as of now, no US UAV (or any robot) will be able to launch any kind of weapon in an offensive environment without human direction and approval. However, the 3000.09 Directive does contain a clause that allows for this possibility in the future. This caveat states that the development of a weapon system that independently decides to launch a weapon is possible but first must be approved by the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy (USD(P)); the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (USD(AT&L)); and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Not all stakeholders are happy with this policy that leaves the door open for what used to be considered science fiction. Many opponents of such uses of technologies call for either an outright ban on autonomous weaponized systems, or in some cases, autonomous systems in general (Human Rights Watch 2013, Future of Life Institute 2015, Chairperson of the Informal Meeting of Experts 2016). Such groups take the position that weapons systems should always be under \"meaningful human control,\" but do not give a precise definition of what this means. One issue in this debate that often is overlooked is that autonomy is not a discrete state, rather it is a continuum, and various weapons with different levels of autonomy have been in the US inventory for some time. Because of these ambiguities, it is often hard to draw the line between automated and autonomous systems. Present-day UAVs use the very same guidance, navigation and control technology flown on commercial aircraft. Tomahawk missiles, which have been in the US inventory for more than 30 years, are highly automated weapons with accuracies of less than a meter. These offensive missiles can navigate by themselves with no GPS, thus exhibiting some autonomy by today's definitions. Global Hawk UAVs can find their way home and land on their own without any human intervention in the case of a communication failure. The growth of the civilian UAV market is also a critical consideration in the debate as to whether these technologies should be banned outright. There is a $144.38B industry emerging for the commercial use of drones in agricultural settings, cargo delivery, first response, commercial photography, and the entertainment industry (Adroit Market Research 2019) More than $100 billion has been spent on driverless car development (Eisenstein 2018) in the past 10 years and the autonomy used in driverless cars mirrors that inside autonomous weapons. So, it is an important distinction that UAVs are simply the platform for weapon delivery (autonomous or conventional), and that autonomous systems have many peaceful and commercial uses independent of military applications\"--"

The book opens by focusing on European-based civil law, represented by German law, before moving on to the common law legal tradition seen in English law. Some comparative law casebooks and study guides stop with Western law but Global Legal Traditions continues by turning to the study of a secular non-European legal tradition by examining Chinese law, or more specifically the law of the People's Republic of China. The book's final section covers the non-state, religion-based legal tradition found in Islamic law, both in its pre-state form and how Islamic law manifests itself within the confines of sovereign state powers. Each part contains seven chapters intended to enable students to draw comparisons and make distinctions between the legal traditions under review. Each part includes five chapters covering common topics: history and development of the legal tradition; political process; judicial process; legal actors and legal education; and civil law. The remaining two chapters for each part focus on a legal subject most relevant to that legal tradition\"--"

In Oman, a historical seafaring nation on the south-eastern corner of the Arabian Peninsula, a culture of agreement that accommodates the interests of everyone has developed around the division of scarce water resources. Life in the arid inland of the Omani Hajar mountains would not have been possible without water. Irrigation channel (falaj) construction is extremely old and skilful therein. Local practices evolved around the division of water and land on the basis of fairness. The community would be best served by inclusion and the avoidance of conflict. A specific Islamic school called Ibadi arrived at Oman early on in the eighth century. Ibadi scholars conserved local practices. Consultation and mediation by sheikhs and the religious leader, Imam, became the law of the land. The Omanis were known as the People of Consultation, Ahl Al Shura. In time, the practice of inclusive agreements would extend far beyond the village level, affecting Omani's foreign policy under Sultan Qaboos. Omani's water diplomacy succeeded in uniting the contestants of the Middle East Peace Process in the 1990s to work together on common problems of water desalination."
